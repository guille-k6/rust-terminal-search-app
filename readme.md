# Search app.
Project from the 12Â° chapter of the rust-lang book.
This application takes two parameters from the terminal as an input:
- p1: word to be searched.
- p2: file to be read.

> Ex: *cargo run -- the poem.txt*

The application will look for the lines that contains that word to be searched and will print it out to the console.
